## Problem Statement


## Solution

Rectangular prism dimentions that have equal surface area and volume are as follows:
    - 3 x 7 x 42
    - 3 x 8 x 24
    - 3 x 9 x 18
    - 3 x 10 x 15
    - 3 x 12 x 12
    - 4 x 5 x 20
    - 4 x 6 x 12
    - 4 x 8 x 8
    - 5 x 5 x 10
    - 6 x 6 x 6

## Solution Methodology

Pretty simple script this time around.  Iterated through all values in the range of a specified maximum.  If that specific combination of dimentions resulted in a rectangular prism with equal surface area and volume print the combination.
